To ensure the code and software I have created is working, I'm thorough in the testing and validating process at each stage of development. Designing and running unit tests help to discover and correct coding errors early, and following secure coding practices — such as user input validation and proper handling of data — can help mitigate security vulnerabilities.


When gathering and interpreting user needs, I employ a detailed review of requirements and take time to imagine the process of how the program will actually be used in practical, real-world scenarios. I ensure that the design is aligned with user expectations while keeping usability and reliability as primary focuses. I also solicit and act on feedback from users or stakeholders regularly to enhance the program as is warranted to address user needs.


My software design approach begins with planning and understanding the problem before writing code. I break the project down into smaller, more approachable pieces, identify the anticipated functionality of modeling each piece, and consider how the design can promote scalability and maintainability. The outcome of this organized, agreeable, user-centered process can be software that is operate efficiently and can be relied on.
